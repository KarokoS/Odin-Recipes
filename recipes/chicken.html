        <h2>Aussie Chicken Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe is very similar to a chicken dish served at a local 
            well-known restaurant. A friend of mine was kind enough to share 
            it. It includes chicken breasts topped with mushrooms, bacon and 
            cheese cooked in a honey-mustard sauce.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients<h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons seasoning salt</li>
                <li>6 slices bacon, cut in half </li>
                <li>½ cup prepared yellow mustard </li>
                <li>½ cup honey</li>
                <li>¼ cup light corn syrup </li>
                <li>¼ cup mayonnaise </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1</li>
                <p>
                    Rub the chicken breasts with the seasoning salt, cover 
                    and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
                </p>

                <li>Step 2</li>
                <p>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                    Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over 
                    medium high heat until crisp. Set aside.
                </p>

                <li>Step 3</li>
                <p>
                    In a medium bowl, combine the mustard, honey, 
                    corn syrup, mayonnaise and dried onion flakes. 
                    Remove half of sauce, cover and refrigerate to serve later.
                </p>

                <li>Step 4</li>
                <p>
                    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                    Place the breasts in the skillet and saute for 
                    3 to 5 minutes per side, or until browned. 
                    Remove from skillet and place the breasts into 
                    a 9x13 inch baking dish. Apply the honey mustard 
                    sauce to each breast, then layer each breast with 
                    mushrooms and bacon. Sprinkle top with shredded cheese.
                </p>

                <li>Step 4</li>
                <p>
                    Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese 
                    is melted and chicken juices run clear. Garnish with 
                    parsley and serve with the reserved honey mustard sauce.
                </p>
            </ol>
